Mount comes in two choices. 3 Piece set, or 1 piece. The 3-piece set clicks together like the stated above kits, and allows for replacement pieces to quickly be switched out, instead of the whole mount if 1 part was to get damaged.

Mount allows Moto E4 to click in, or slid in, but should be slid out the top of the mount afterwords. Mount is a beefed up version, while allowing access to the buttons of the E4. Top Clip, or top part of the mount is already rounded out so buttons will not be hit by the mount itself. Offers support to the bottom of the phone, and optional Ziptie-able USB holes. 

Hole Pattern is both Tetrix and Actobotics.
