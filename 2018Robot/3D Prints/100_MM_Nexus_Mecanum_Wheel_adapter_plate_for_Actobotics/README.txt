# Summary

This is our adapter plate for 100MM Nexus Mecanum wheels that is fully 3D printed. Here's a link from the manufacturer - http://www.nexusrobot.com/product/a-set-of-4-inch-100mm-mecanum-wheels-4-pieces-bearing-rollers-14094.html - though you can get them from many other places cheaper.

We have been using these wheels on our robots since the Velocity Vortex season and have had no issues with them.


For each wheel, you need two adapters - one for each side. There are 6 holes on the outer ring - these screw into the wheels, and then there are 4 on the inside, which are for the Actobotics pattern.

Before you put the adapter on the wheel, you have to get whatever hub, gear, or sprocket onto the wheel. There are hex holes for 6-32 Nylock nuts for using gears or chain, for a hub you can just put the heads of the screws in those hex holes.

In order to get the whole thing assembled, on one side, in 3 of the hex holes press in the Nylock Nuts that came with the wheels - The wheels come with 3 screws and nuts already in, remove those and use them for pressing in. The wheels also come with a longer set of screws, which is what you should use. In the other side, put the screws in - the heads should fully rest in the hex holes. You can tighten everything up, and its worth noting that it's hard to fully tighten the screws attaching to the wheels.

A couple things worth noting - 

1: The insert that comes in the mecanum wheel (The white thing in the middle) had a bigger side and a smaller side, you want your hub and whatever screws to go in on the bigger side, or you'll have a bunch of resistance.

2: Sometimes when using a gear or sprocket, if you've fully tightened the part onto the adapter before putting it on the wheel, it won't go on due to the screws stopping it. In this case loosen the screws until they don't protrude from the nuts and then mount the adapters onto the wheels. Then tighten the screws for your actobotics parts.
