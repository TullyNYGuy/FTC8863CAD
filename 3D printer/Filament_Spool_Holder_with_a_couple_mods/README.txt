# Summary

Not what I really consider a remix since I just modded a few things

1. Added 2mm height to the studs the bearings go on so there is more material holding the bearings when the studs are melted and squished.
2. Added a 0.18mm high (1 layer) flat area to the end of the screw to act as a brim so everything can be printed together easily. Naturally it has to be trimmed off after printing to assemble the screw and knob.
3. Flipped the "slider" 180 degrees so it's oriented to go on the build plate by default.

The knob was not modified at all.

 Be sure you put the screw in the "base" before gluing the knob on it.
